	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

    <p>
        I want to become a software developer because it represents the perfect intersection 
        of logic and creativity. The ability to take an abstract idea and transform it into 
        a functional tool that solves real-world problems is incredibly empowering. I am 
        motivated by the constant evolution of technology, which ensures that I will never 
        stop learning, and I look forward to contributing to projects that make information 
        more accessible and life more efficient for people everywhere.
